;   Uneasy allies
;   by Steady Goh
;   story line by Sun Wu Kong

;  You and several nations formed an alliance to attack and destroy The 3 central  nations and their allies.  There has been rumors that these 3 nations are wealthy enough to produce an army strong enough to rule the world.  You don't know how strong is their combined army at this time, but if you don't act soon, it just might be too late!  You also know that your allies are also power hungry and that if they defeat the enemy and gain the resources before you do, they will not hesitate to break the alliance and declare war on each other along with yourself!
