; Map name: Show Down
; Created by Kelvin Tan

; This map is created for precisely this purpose, a show down between 2 enemies! It is a 3 by 10 map with a reasonable amount of resources to start with, and with lots more just to the left and right side of the 2 starting squares. Each player is also given 20 archers and 20 foot men to start with. However, meadows are pity scarce in this map, or should i say, both players have to make peasants work to uncover meadows for building buildings.

; Keep a cool head, and keep your fingers working, and i am sure you will have no problem defeating your opponent in show down!
; Enjoy!
