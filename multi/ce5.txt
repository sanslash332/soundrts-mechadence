; ======================================
; This map is a square with a cross in his center. There's a river on the frontiers between the square and the "parts" of the cross. Minimum: 2 players; maximum: 4 players. There are many resources, but I used the preprocessor directives when I created the map, so this resources will be on different places... This map is very little for 4 people, then pay attention, else you'll be fastly submerged. HAVE FUN! :-) (AND DO NOT forget that the cross is a very good hiding-place if you have mages! ;)
