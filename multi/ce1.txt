; ======================================
; You'll begin with three farms, six peasants, five flying machines, and one of each existing building sorts. You begin also with 600 gold and 350 wood. In the middle of the map, there's a river, and on each side of it you'll find "big resources" : one gold mine of 2000 units and two woods of 1000 units on each side of the river. But pay attention, they aren't on the same square ! Now, break your ennemy, win, develop the destruction !!! :-D
